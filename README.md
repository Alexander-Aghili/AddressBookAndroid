This will guide you on how to download and run the app.

Download the code directly into the AndroidStudioProjects or similar directory, and run the code. You may attempt it on any device above Marshmellow 6.0, however, only API 29 and 30 are guaranteed to work.

Tested Devices:
- Pixel 3a API 29 Emulator
- Pixel XL API 30 Emulator

How it works:
  1. First the list starts out empty, to add to the list, press the Add Contact button at the button.
  2. Once you press the button, you will be on the Add Contact page.
  3. You can add a name in the text area.
  4. If you choose to not add to the list, click the Cancel button in the bottom left to return to the screen, you will still have all of your old contacts.
  5. If you want to add to the list, press Add Contact in the bottom right when you have entered the name. 
  6. The name will appear on the list, you may add another using the same process. The names will not persist.

The limited use of the Service will be improved upon with later implementations, as I felt the service often made tasks more difficult. When the implementation of the service allows for needed agility, I will add that in.
